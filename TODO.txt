Urgent TODO:
    - Implement Braintree for payment
    - Enable user to user messages
    - Enable search filtering:
        - by location
        - by tags
    - Enable anonymous donations (must capture email). Enable user creation via donate page. Enable user creation via email link. Enable cookie persistence for returning users.
    - Dynamically create comment forms to enable parent/child commenting
    - Enable commenting 'as ministry' editable from comment form.
    - Get rid of plain html links:
        - incorrect login or invalid sign up
    - Convert News post to Card (from Angular Material)
    - Gallery for ministries/campaigns of aggregated media
    - Ability to add multiple media items to NewsPost
    - Implement Toasts (via AngularJS) to show messages from django (`get_messages`). Pass via hidden input objects and fetch via js `getElementById`
    - Implement file uploading as 'new upload' and then have `img_path` be an option of selected uploaded files
    - Social media links for ministries
    - Map displaying ministry location (via 'explore' tab)
    - Implement OneToOneField for storing pickled geopy object for user locations and MinistryProfile addresses
    - Truncate long ministry/profile names in nav bar header and 'h' elements/content

Overall TODOs:
    - implement TimelineJS
    - Automatic Post Creation upon reaching milestones (email notification to admin email & should be a setting and editable)
    - Create dynamic background or something for progress-bar. Dynamic update of progress-bar
    - Dynamic Countdown
    - Voting system and video Submission (via splash page w/ submission period)
    - Mailing list functionality
    - Add detailed logging (individual log files: requests, user creation, donation, etc)
    - Secure logout function (logout on POST, not GET)
    - enable dynamic width for progress bar
    - Create more admin like page for Profile management
    - Implement page history via js
    - Implement donation guestbook-like functionality. "people who have donated have said:"
    - Implement `User.first_login` for displaying help-text on profile template
    - Self-deleting `Donation` objects (after a few hours) when there is no payment. This can be expanded to moderator (for comments, etc)
    - Clear comment form when canceled
    - Style payment selection to show icons next to radio buttons
    - Enable multiple admins, and permissions.
    - Javascript is becoming atrocious. Make this better! (basically make full use of REST and dump page templates. Every element should be a template returnable by django or something)
        - User alias functionality should not reload page twice (to refresh name in header)

Long-term TODOs:
    - Angular is going to be defunct soon. Convert website to angular.io (there is a Material library for angular.io)
    - Have Tags tab showing new and popular objects per tag
    - Enable ministries to input multiple locations
